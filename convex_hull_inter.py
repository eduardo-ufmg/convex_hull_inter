def convex_hull_inter(
    Q: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, factor_h: float, factor_k: int
) -> float:
    """
    Computes the volume of the intersection of convex hulls for multiple classes.

    For each class, the function treats the corresponding rows in Q as points in an
    N-dimensional space, where N is the number of classes. It computes the convex
    hull for each class's points. It then finds the intersection of all these
    hulls and calculates the N-dimensional volume of that intersection.

    Parameters:
        Q (np.ndarray): An (M, N) similarity matrix where M is the number of samples
                        and N is the number of classes. Q[i, c] is the similarity
                        of sample i to class c. These rows are treated as points
                        in an N-dimensional space.
        y (np.ndarray): An (M,) array of labels, where y[i] is the integer class
                        label for sample i.
        factor_h (float): A scaled factor from the RBF kernel bandwidth parameter.
        factor_k (int): A scaled factor from the number of nearest neighbors used in
                        the sparse RBF kernel.

    Returns:
        float: The N-dimensional volume of the intersection of all class-based
               convex hulls. Returns 0.0 if the intersection is empty or
               doesn't form an N-dimensional solid (i.e., it's flat).
